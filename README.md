# MiniGUI Documents

We maintains the documents for MiniGUI Core and MiniGUI components in this repository.

MiniGUI aims to provide a fast, stable, full-featured, and cross-platform windowing and GUI support system,
        which is especially fit for embedded systems or smart IoT devices based-on Linux/uClinux, eCos,
        and other traditional RTOSes, such as RT-Thread, FreeRTOS, RTEMS, VxWorks, ThreadX, Nucleus, pSOS, uC/OS-II, OSE, and others.

This is the source tree of MiniGUI Core, which provides the windowing and graphics interfaces as well as a lot of standard controls (toolkit).

MiniGUI is released under GPLv3 and the dual-licensing applies to commercial use.
In December 1998, the initiator of FMSoft, [Vincent Wei], began to develop MiniGUI under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
In September 2002, the core developers of MiniGUI founded [FMSoft] and started the commercial marketing with the free software.
By now, FMSoft still continues to release MiniGUI as a free software project.

## Current Status

We have cleaned up the following documents:

- MiniGUI User Manual
- MiniGUI Programming Guide
- MiniGUI Supplementary Documents

The following documents need to be written:

- [The C++ UX Framework](/programming-guide/MiniGUIProgGuidePart4Chapter03.md)
- [Code Style and Project Specification](/programming-guide/MiniGUIProgGuideAppendixA.md)

We hope that we can finish this work at the end of the year 2019.
